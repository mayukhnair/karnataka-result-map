# karnataka-result-map

This was part of an assignment for Data Driven Journalism (Spring 2019) by Prof. Sudheendra Hangal and Prof. Siddhartha Dubey.

Election result data was provided from [Lok Dhaba](https://lokdhaba.ashoka.edu.in/), a project on Indian election data by [Trivedi Centre for Political Data, Ashoka University](https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/).

This code sample is an R script that uses RGDAL (R Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) and Leaflet to build a JavaScript map for election results in Karnataka, India. Each constituency is color coded by a color assigned to the winning candidate's political party using RColorBrewer.
